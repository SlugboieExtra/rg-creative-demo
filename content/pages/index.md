      My name is Jacob Cloutier and I am running for the position of councilor
      for our beloved Marysville (Ward 5).
    text: >+
      If elected, there are four key areas I plan to address:


      *   Homelessness & poverty.


      *   Infrastructure issues such as we are seeing with the Marysville
      Bridge. There have also been growing concerns with the quality of our
      sidewalks, especially during winter months.


      *   Development of a strong business and employee ecosystem for the
      Fredericton Region.


      *   Councilor wage control

      I will be visiting door to door throughout 2024 to learn about your needs
      and desires for Marysville and Fredericton in general. This will help me
      to focus on what matters most to you. I intend to follow up in 2025 and
      2026 with additional outreach and surveys to make sure I am on track and
      stay aligned with community needs.


      If elected, I will continue to listen and stay on course to support all of
      Ward 5 and Fredericton.


      Between now and the election day I will be meeting with as many local
      leaders and professionals as I can that effect or have insight about our
      city and talk about what we are doing right and what we could do better ,
      my goal will be to meet with over 100 of these individuals at this stage I
      have met with 15.
