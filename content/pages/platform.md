      **I will be visiting door to door throughout 2024 to learn about your
      needs and desires for Marysville and Fredericton in general. This will
      help me to focus on what matters most to you. I intend to follow up in
      2025 and 2026 with additional outreach and surveys to make sure I am on
      track and stay aligned with community needs.**


      **If elected, I will continue to listen and stay on course to support all
      of Ward 5 and Fredericton.**

My approach to addressing this issue involves several key strategies:\n\n*   Not charging property tax on shelters and properties used to serve our homeless.\n\n*   Collaborating closely with non-profit organizations to enhance the support services available to the homeless population.\n\n*   Facilitating employment opportunities for the homeless, fostering their integration as productive members of our community.\n\n*   Partnering with the provincial government to enhance housing and healthcare services tailored to the needs of the homeless.\n\n*   Streamlining shelter operations to prioritize emergency overflow situations, ensuring efficient utilization of resources.\n\n*   Aligning our efforts with the policies and initiatives of both federal and provincial authorities.\n\n*   Promoting greater understanding and empathy within the community towards homelessness, fostering a supportive environment for individuals seeking assistance and rehabilitation.\n\n"

      ### Councillor Wage Control



      The recent decision by Fredericton's councillors and mayor to approve a
      pay raise for themselves (34% increase) is concerning to me. I share
      Councillor Hicks' sentiment that this was not the appropriate time or
      manner to address such a matter. I believe there should be a structured
      system in place to regulate the wages of councillors and the mayor. In a
      gesture of goodwill, I am committed to addressing this issue and hopefully
      even reverse the decision until a more appropriate time or until a
      structured system is in place.


      ### Investing in Growth



      I advocate for directing additional spending towards growth initiatives
      aimed at enhancing the prosperity and wealth of the city. Funds generated
      from these successful endeavors should then be allocated to various
      projects, ensuring a continuous focus on growth in our budgetary
      allocations. This approach enables us to afford luxuries that may
      otherwise be beyond our reach compared to other cities. Additionally,
      there should be a mandate to set aside a portion of funds as a contingency
      reserve for unforeseeable emergencies.
