      **I will be visiting door to door throughout 2024 to learn about your
      needs and desires for Marysville and Fredericton in general. This will
      help me to focus on what matters most to you. I intend to follow up in

      track and stay aligned with community needs.**

      ### Councillor Wage Control



      The recent decision by Fredericton's councillors and mayor to approve a
      pay raise for themselves (34% increase) is concerning to me. I share
      Councillor Hicks' sentiment that this was not the appropriate time or
      manner to address such a matter. I believe there should be a structured
      system in place to regulate the wages of councillors and the mayor. In a
      gesture of goodwill, I am committed to addressing this issue and hopefully
      even reverse the decision until a more appropriate time or until a
      structured system is in place.


      ### Investing in Growth



      I advocate for directing additional spending towards growth initiatives
      aimed at enhancing the prosperity and wealth of the city. Funds generated
      from these successful endeavors should then be allocated to various
      projects, ensuring a continuous focus on growth in our budgetary
      allocations. This approach enables us to afford luxuries that may
      otherwise be beyond our reach compared to other cities. Additionally,
      there should be a mandate to set aside a portion of funds as a contingency
      reserve for unforeseeable emergencies.

      ### The Right Business Ecosystem


      Fredericton needs a more diverse Ecosystem for businesses and workers to
      thrive and I plan to invest time in helping develop this area of
      opportunity for Fredericton. Ignite, Planet Hatch, ACOA and ONB have done
      an amazing job so far but there are still areas of opportunity for us to
      do more and become better. This is going to come down to connecting with
      all kinds of professionals, listening to input, and taking the best advice
      that will align with our vision for a healthy ecosystem. I would like to
      see Ignite better align with the goals of ONB and have them help fill gaps
      that ONB has.


      ### Workers Support


      While I may not endorse all the outcomes associated with unions, I
      consider myself a supporter. My previous career involved actively
      participating in a union, including strikes and picketing alongside fellow
      members of CUPE. Even after leaving, I continue to demonstrate my support
      for those still affiliated with unions. My backing extends to hardworking
      individuals striving for fair wages, decent benefits, and better working
      conditions. I plan to ensure that city workers are treated fairly And get
      what they deserve as well as anyone within our City I can support on this
      object

      ### Provincial Support


      As May 2026 approaches I am preparing to run for Ward 5 city Council.
      Change is needed as our city has faced growing challenges in social
      programs such as welfare and housing, and we should not be left to
      shoulder this burden alone. As your councillor, Iâ€™ll work to make the
      province more accountable. We need better cooperation between city and
      provincial authorities to address these pressing issues. Together, we will
      advocate for a fairer distribution of resources and support for our
      community.


      ### Roads & Bridges


      The ongoing problems with several bridges and roads in recent years have
      been a significant concern that requires urgent resolution. Many of these
      issues seem to stem from provincial jurisdiction over these bridges and
      roads. I believe it's time for Fredericton to negotiate with the province
      to gain control over these infrastructures, allowing us to ensure their
      proper maintenance and upkeep.


      ### Provincial Respect


      It may seem I do not have respect for our province and government
      officials within the province but I really do have the greatest respect
      for them and the hard choices they need to make but they need to be
      reminded of their duty to their cities.

      ### Sidewalks


      The City has struggled to prioritize addressing the glaring issue of our
      sidewalks during the winter months. These pathways are relied upon by some
      of our most vulnerable residents for travel, yet they often become
      dangerous and impassable. If voted councillor, I am committed to
      dedicating the necessary time and effort to tackle this issue head-on. I
      have already engaged with engineers who believe there are simple and
      cost-effective solutions available. They are prepared to draft these plans
      for as little as $1000. I am determined to raise the funds required to
      bring these plans to the city immediately, rather than delaying any
      further. It's imperative that we take action now to address this problem
      and ensure the safety and accessibility of our city for all residents.

      ### Community Information Sharing


      I believe there's room for improvement in how Fredericton educates its
      residents about city events and activities. Engage Fredericton is a
      valuable resource, but the city hasn't effectively encouraged citizen
      participation. People seek information conveniently, and unless we adapt
      to deliver it when, how, and where they prefer, our engagement efforts
      will fall short.


      ### Wifi Access


      As part of my commitment to enhancing connectivity and access to
      information across our community, I would seek to expand the Fredericton
      free Wi-Fi program to include Maryville. This initiative would bridge what
      I see as a gap with the current service, ensuring that residents in all
      parts of our city have equal access to online resources for education,
      business, and communication. By expanding free Wi-Fi to Maryville, we will
      support local businesses, increase access to essential services, and
      create more opportunities for residents to engage with their community and
      the broader world. This is a crucial step towards making Fredericton a
      more connected and inclusive place.
