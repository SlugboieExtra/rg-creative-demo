    subtitle: for Ward 5 Fredericton City Council.
    text: >
      I will be visiting door to door throughout 2024 to learn about your needs
      and desires for Marysville and Fredericton in general. This will help me
      to focus on what matters most to you. I intend to follow up in 2025 and
      2026 with additional outreach and surveys to make sure I am on track and
      stay aligned with community needs.


      If elected, I will continue to listen and stay on course to support all of
      Ward 5 and Fredericton.

    text: "Currently, there are approximately\_**150**\_individuals experiencing homelessness in Fredericton. My approach to addressing this issue involves several key strategies:\n\n*   Not charging property tax on shelters and properties used to serve our homeless.\n\n*   Collaborating closely with non-profit organizations to enhance the support services available to the homeless population.\n\n*   Facilitating employment opportunities for the homeless, fostering their integration as productive members of our community.\n\n*   Partnering with the provincial government to enhance housing and healthcare services tailored to the needs of the homeless.\n\n*   Streamlining shelter operations to prioritize emergency overflow situations, ensuring efficient utilization of resources.\n\n*   Aligning our efforts with the policies and initiatives of both federal and provincial authorities.\n\n*   Promoting greater understanding and empathy within the community towards homelessness, fostering a supportive environment for individuals seeking assistance and rehabilitation.\n\n"
