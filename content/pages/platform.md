      **I will be visiting door to door throughout 2024 to learn about your
      needs and desires for Marysville and Fredericton in general. This will
      help me to focus on what matters most to you. I intend to follow up in
      2025 and 2026 with additional outreach and surveys to make sure I am on
      track and stay aligned with community needs.**


      **If elected, I will continue to listen and stay on course to support all
      of Ward 5 and Fredericton.**

      ### Councillor Wage Control



      The recent decision by Fredericton's councillors and mayor to approve a
      pay raise for themselves (34% increase) is concerning to me. I share
      Councillor Hicks' sentiment that this was not the appropriate time or
      manner to address such a matter. I believe there should be a structured
      system in place to regulate the wages of councillors and the mayor. In a
      gesture of goodwill, I am committed to addressing this issue and hopefully
      even reverse the decision until a more appropriate time or until a
      structured system is in place.


      ### Investing in Growth



      I advocate for directing additional spending towards growth initiatives
      aimed at enhancing the prosperity and wealth of the city. Funds generated
      from these successful endeavors should then be allocated to various
      projects, ensuring a continuous focus on growth in our budgetary
      allocations. This approach enables us to afford luxuries that may
      otherwise be beyond our reach compared to other cities. Additionally,
      there should be a mandate to set aside a portion of funds as a contingency
      reserve for unforeseeable emergencies.

      ### The Right Business Ecosystem


      Fredericton needs a more diverse Ecosystem for businesses and workers to
      thrive and I plan to invest time in helping develop this area of
      opportunity for Fredericton. Ignite, Planet Hatch, ACOA and ONB have done
      an amazing job so far but there are still areas of opportunity for us to
      do more and become better. This is going to come down to connecting with
      all kinds of professionals, listening to input, and taking the best advice
      that will align with our vision for a healthy ecosystem. I would like to
      see Ignite better align with the goals of ONB and have them help fill gaps
      that ONB has.


      ### Workers Support


      While I may not endorse all the outcomes associated with unions, I
      consider myself a supporter. My previous career involved actively
      participating in a union, including strikes and picketing alongside fellow
      members of CUPE. Even after leaving, I continue to demonstrate my support
      for those still affiliated with unions. My backing extends to hardworking
      individuals striving for fair wages, decent benefits, and better working
      conditions. I plan to ensure that city workers are treated fairly And get
      what they deserve as well as anyone within our City I can support on this
