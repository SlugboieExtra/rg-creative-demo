      Marysville is a historic and dynamic suburb of Fredericton, home to a
      growing community of over 5,957 residents as of 2023. Situated along the
      beautiful Nashwaak River and just a few kilometers northeast of downtown,
      Marysville combines its rich heritage with modern suburban life, making it
      an attractive place to live and work.


      ### A Growing and Diverse Community


      In recent years, Marysville has experienced a population growth of 20%,
      highlighting the area’s increasing appeal. However, this growth brings new
      challenges, particularly in housing and affordability. While many families
      are thriving, 361 households earn less than $39,999 annually and are
      considered below the poverty line. Affordable housing remains a priority,
      with legacy rents at $854 per month significantly lower than current
      market averages, which have risen to $1,275 as of 2024. This increase in
      housing costs underscores the need for more affordable living options in
      our community.


      ### Transportation and Connectivity


      Transportation is also a critical issue for Marysville residents, with
      many relying on public transit or personal vehicles to commute. Routes 43,
      85, and 82 serve the area, helping connect Marysville with the rest of
      Fredericton. However, there is still room to improve public transit
      options and make commuting more convenient and affordable for everyone.


      ### Affordable Housing Initiatives


      One of my top priorities is addressing the growing need for affordable
      housing in Ward 5. With 645 renters in the area, many of whom are
      struggling to keep up with rising rental costs, it is essential to
      advocate for housing policies that increase affordability and protect
      vulnerable households. Ensuring that Marysville remains a welcoming
      community for all income levels is a key focus of my platform.


      ### Supporting Our Residents


      Marysville is a place where both homeowners and renters contribute to the
      community’s vibrancy. With 1,722 homeowners and 645 renters, I am
      committed to representing the needs of all residents. We must work
      together to tackle poverty and ensure that every household can maintain a
      basic standard of living. The average annual spending to meet basic needs
      in Marysville is a pressing concern for many families, and I will continue
      to push for policies that support low-income households.


      ### Looking to the Future


      As your representative, I am dedicated to ensuring that Marysville remains
      a connected and thriving community. Expanding the Fredericton free Wi-Fi
      program to include our area will improve access to online resources,
      supporting businesses, students, and families. By addressing
      transportation, housing affordability, and digital connectivity, we can
      build a stronger, more inclusive Ward 5 that meets the needs of all its
      residents.
